Bookmark manager
This week's project is a bookmark manager. The goal is to expose you to the following aspects of web development:

Acceptance testing: Capybara
Relational databases
Security considerations
In addition to the technologies mentioned above, this project is going to be more challenging on the front-end. You shouldn't need more than we've covered in the previous weeks but you should expect to spend more time on the front-end, compared to Battleships â€“ web version. Of course, we'll also continue to be using the technologies we're familiar with: Sinatra, RSpec, etc.
